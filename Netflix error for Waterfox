I am trying to relay this information to Alex Kontos for action for the next Waterfox update. -- @r-a-v-e-n.

As of early hours Tuesday December 7, 2021 (what a date!), Netflix videos no longer play on Waterfox.
They receive the Netflix Error F7121-3078, with the message "Pardon the interruption, Looks like your browser
is no longer supported. Please install the latest version or try another browser".

Two days prior, Netflix videos (including the first half of the SAME movie now unviewable) had been possible
to watch without any problems at all. No browser or system changes had occurred in the meantime.

The browser was Waterfox Current G4.0.3.1 (64-bit), on a macOS BigSur 11.6.1 MacBook -- both the most recent --
and, following instructions, the MacBook was rebooted, the browser restarted, but the same Error recurred.

The error was reported online to Netflix, and by chat to Netflix. The Netflix advisor remarked that Waterfox
is *not* one of the Netflix supported browsers (although Firefox is), and suggested that Waterfox contact
Netflix to coordinate updates to become compatible with Netflix again.
